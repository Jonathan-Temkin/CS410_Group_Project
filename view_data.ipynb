The following algorithm does not compensate for this.\nI'm not sure this is exactly what you want, but this is one way to randomly generate non-repeating color values:\n(beware, inconsistent pseudo-code ahead)\n//colors entered as 0-255 [R, G, B]colors = []; //holds final colors to be usedrand = new Random();//assumes n is less than 16,777,216randomGen(int n){   while (len(colors) < n){      //generate a random number between 0,255 for each color      newRed = rand.next(256);      newGreen = rand.next(256);      newBlue = rand.next(256);      temp = [newRed, newGreen, newBlue];      //only adds new colors to the array      if temp not in colors {         colors.append(temp);      }   }}\nOne way you could optimize this for better visibility would be to compare the distance between each new color and all the colors in the array:\nfor item in color{   itemSq = (item[0]^2 + item[1]^2 + item[2]^2])^(.5);   tempSq = (temp[0]^2 + temp[1]^2 + temp[2]^2])^(.5);   dist = itemSq - tempSq;   dist = abs(dist);}//NUMBER can be your chosen distance apart.if dist < NUMBER and temp not in colors {   colors.append(temp);}\nBut this approach would significantly slow down your algorithm.\nAnother way would be to scrap the randomness and systematically go through every 4 values and add a color to an array in the above example.",

         "I have a little game written in C#. It uses a database as back-end. It's \na trading card game, and I wanted to implement the function of the cards as a script.\nWhat I mean is that I essentially have an interface, ICard, which a card class implements (public class Card056 : ICard) and which contains function that are called by the game.\nNow, to make the thing maintainable/moddable, I would like to have the class for each card as source code in the database and essentially compile it on first use. So when I have to add/change a card, I'll just add it to the database and tell my application to refresh, without needing any assembly deployment (especially since we would be talking about 1 assembly per card which means hundreds of assemblies).\nIs that possible? Register a class from a source file and then instantiate it, etc.\nICard Cards[current] = new MyGame.CardLibrary.Card056();\nCards[current].OnEnterPlay(ref currentGameState);\n\nThe language is C#, but extra bonus if it's possible to write the script in any .NET language.\n",
         "Yes, I thought about that, but I soon figured out that another Domain-Specific-Language (DSL) would be a bit too much.\nEssentially, they need to interact with my gamestate in possibly unpredictable ways. For example, a card could have a rule \"When this cards enter play, all your undead minions gain +3 attack against flying enemies, except when the enemy is blessed\". As trading card games are turn based, the GameState Manager will fire OnStageX events and let the cards modify other cards or the GameState in whatever way the card needs.\nIf I try to create a DSL, I have to implement a rather large feature set and possibly constantly update it, which shifts the maintenance work to another part without actually removing it.\nThat's why I wanted to stay with a \"real\" .NET language to essentially be able to just fire the event and let the card manipulate the gamestate in whatever way (within the limits of the code access security).\n",
